      Cauvery Calling is a first-of-its-kind campaign, setting the standard for revitalizing Indiaâ€™s rivers.
      I worked on the <strong>Cauvery Calling</strong> project, where I built the entire website from scratch using <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>GraphQL</strong>, and <strong>Dato CMS</strong>. This included creating dynamic subpages like blogs, newsletters, the "About" section, and the <strong>Tropical World Blueprint</strong>.
      Throughout the project, I gained experience with:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Next.js</strong> for server-side rendering and optimized routing.</li>
        <li><strong>GraphQL</strong> for efficient data fetching.</li>
        <li><strong>Dato CMS</strong> for managing dynamic content.</li>
        <li><strong>Chakra UI</strong> for responsive and reusable UI components.</li>
      </ul>
      I successfully delivered the project to the UAT phase, ensuring scalability and a seamless user experience.
