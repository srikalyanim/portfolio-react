      "Consicious Planet: This is a full-stack application supporting three key initiatives: Cauvery Calling, Isha Vidhya, and Action for Rural Rejuvenation, along with Rally for Rivers. We began by identifying common components across these projects, streamlining the development process by building a unified UI. Once the core UI was in place, we integrated dynamic content from GraphQL, sourced via DatoCMS, ensuring seamless data delivery across all platforms. From there, we moved through development to deployment, bringing each initiative live. Currently, all projects are in the UAT phase, marking the final step before full-scale release."
